# Dynamic Web Development Week 2

Design and Develop a website about New York using a strong grid drawn from Swiss Poster Design.

## Mood Board and Inspiration

I've done UI/UX work for the past couple of years, and while I do enjoy making websites, I hate the standard conventions around how they're supposed to look, act, and feel. I miss the days when websites were more fun and had more life. I understand accessibility issues, but I also just want to make things.

This week, I was inspired to create an interaction that goes against these standards. I was really drawn to the idea of working with physics and having an object behave differently every time you load the page. I found some examples that embody that idea while still maintaining a Swiss-style grid structure.

While moodboarding, I also came across some designs with a strong grid but with letter-spacing (kerning) much tighter than typical Swiss posters.

## Sketches, Wireframes, and Style Guide

I wish I had more time to spend on design, but I also wanted to spent a good bulk of time exploring interaction. I use very minimal generative AI when I work so I spent a lot of time figuring certain things out.
