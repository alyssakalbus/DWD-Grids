## Mood Board and Inspiration

I've done UI/UX work for the past couple of years and while I do enjoy making websites I hate the standard conventions around how they're supposed to look, act, and feel. I miss the days where websites were more fun and had more life. I understand accessability issues, but I also just want to make things. This week I was inspired to create an interaction that goes against these standards. I was really drawn to the the idea of working with phsyics, and having an object be different every time you load the page. I found some examples that I think embody that idea while maintaining a swiss-style grid structure. While moodboarding I also came across some designs with a strong grid, but that kearn the letters much closer together than typical swiss posters.
